A group of 12 pirates finds a chest of gold coins. After the coins are 
distributed evenly among the pirates, they find that there are 4 gold coins 
remaining. After a heated argument about how the remaining 4 coins should be 
distributed, two of the pirates are killed. The coins can now be split evenly 
among the crew. What's the smallest number of coins that could have been in 
the chest?
